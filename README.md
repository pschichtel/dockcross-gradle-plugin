Dockcross Gradle Plugin
=======================

This is a very simple gradle plugin that runs arbitrary commands inside [dockcross](https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross) images using, by default, other podman or docker.

The primary purpose of this plugin is cross-compilation of native components for JNI. An example of the plugin in action is [JavaCAN](https://github.com/pschichtel/JavaCAN).
